# = Helper To Make Resource APIs Includable
#
# Inclusion of related resource lets your API return resources related to the
# primary data. This endpoint will support an +include+ request parameter to
# allow the client to customize which related resources should be returned.
#
# This design made references to the rules of <em>Inclusion of Related
# Resources</em> in <em>JSON API</em>:
# http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-includes
#
# For instance, comments could be requested with articles:
#
#   GET /articles?include=comments
#
# The server will respond
#
#   [
#     {
#       "id": 1,
#       "title": "First Post",
#       "content": "...",
#       "comments": [
#         {
#           "id": 1,
#           "content": "..."
#         },
#         {
#           "id": 3,
#           "content": "..."
#         },
#         {
#           "id": 6,
#           "content": "..."
#         }
#       ]
#     },
#     {
#       "id": 2,
#       "title": "Second Post",
#       "content": "...",
#       "comments": [
#         {
#           "id": 2,
#           "content": "..."
#         },
#         {
#           "id": 4,
#           "content": "..."
#         },
#         {
#           "id": 5,
#           "content": "..."
#         }
#       ]
#     }
#   ]
#
# instead of just:
#
#   [
#     {
#       "id": 1,
#       "title": "First Post",
#       "content": "...",
#       "comments": [1, 3, 6]
#     },
#     {
#       "id": 2,
#       "title": "Second Post",
#       "content": "...",
#       "comments": [2, 4, 5]
#     }
#   ]
#
# If requesting multiple related resources is needed, they can be stated in a
# comma-separated list:
#
#   GET /articles/12?include=author,comments
#
# == Usage
#
# Include this +Concern+ in your Grape API class:
#
#   class SampleAPI < Grape::API
#     include APIResourceIncludable
#   end
#
# then set the options for the inclusion in the grape method:
#
#   resources :posts do
#     get do
#       inclusion_for :post, root: true
#       # ...
#     end
#   end
#
# <em>Further usage of +inclusion_for+ method can be found in the {docs of
# the +HelperMethods+ class}[rdoc-ref:APIResourceIncludable::HelperMethods].</em>
#
# This helper parses the +include+ and <tt>include[object_type]</tt> parameters to
# determine what the API caller wants, and save the results into instance
# variables for further usage.
#
# After this you can use the +inclusion+ helper method to get the inclusion data
# that the request specifies, and do something like this in your controller:
#
#   resource = resource.includes(:author) if inclusion(:post, :author)
#
# The +inclusion+ helper method returns data like this:
#
#   inclusion #=> { post: [:author] }
#   inclusion(:post) #=> [:author]
#   inclusion(:post, :author) #=> true
#
# === API View with RABL
#
# If you're using RABL as the API view, it can be setup like this:
#
#   # set the includable and default inclusion fields of the view
#   set_inclusion :post, default_includes: [:author]
#
#   # set the details for all includable fields
#   set_inclusion_field :post, :author, :author_id
#
#   # extends the partial to show included fields
#   extends('extensions/includable_childs', locals: { self_resource: :post })
